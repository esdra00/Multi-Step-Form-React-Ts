## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-    Complete each step of the sequence
-    Go back to a previous step to update their selections
-    See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
-    View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-    See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-    Receive form validation messages if:
     -    A field has been missed
     -    The email address is not formatted correctly
     -    A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
